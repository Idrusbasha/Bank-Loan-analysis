# Bank-Loan-analysis

### Project Description

Developed and implemented a comprehensive **Bank Loan Report** to monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance. The report was designed to provide in-depth insights into key loan-related metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Analysis:** Calculated and tracked vital metrics, including Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average Debt-to-Income Ratio. Employed Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) analyses to identify trends and changes in loan metrics over time.
  
- **Loan Quality Assessment:** Created a classification system to evaluate loan performance, distinguishing between 'Good Loans' (e.g., Fully Paid, Current) and 'Bad Loans' (e.g., Charged Off). Analyzed metrics such as Loan Application Percentage, Funded Amount, and Total Received Amount for both categories to assess the quality of the loan portfolio.
  
- **Grid View Reporting:** Developed a Grid View Report to categorize loans by status and provide a detailed overview of lending operations. This included metrics like Total Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income Ratio.
  
- **Dashboard Development:** Designed and implemented interactive dashboards using various chart types (Line Charts, Filled Maps, Donut Charts, Bar Charts, Tree Maps) to visualize monthly trends, regional lending activity, loan term distribution, borrower employment length, loan purpose, and home ownership status.

- **Details Dashboard:** Created a comprehensive dashboard providing a consolidated view of essential loan data, offering users a user-friendly interface to access detailed insights into the bank's loan portfolio and borrower profiles. 

## Domain Knownledge
Bank loans are essential financial tools for individuals and businesses, but borrowers need to understand the terms and responsibilities involved.

### Data Collection by Banks

Banks gather loan data through:

- **Loan Applications**: Detailed personal and financial information provided by borrowers.
- **Credit Reports**: Credit history and payment behavior accessed from credit bureaus.
- **Internal Records**: Records of transactions, repayments, and loan statuses.
- **Online Portals**: Data from online loan applications and payments.
- **Third-party Sources**: Additional data from external sources like income verification services.

### Loan Approval Process

1. **Application Submission**: Customers apply for loans in person or online.
2. **Review and Verification**: Banks check identity, credit history, income, and employment.
3. **Risk and Collateral Assessment**: Evaluation of credit risk and, if applicable, collateral.
4. **Approval or Denial**: Decision based on the assessment; if approved, terms are set.
5. **Agreement and Disbursement**: Signing of the loan agreement and release of funds.
6. **Repayment and Monitoring**: Borrowers make payments; banks monitor loan status.

### Importance of Loan Data Analysis

- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating borrower creditworthiness and predicting defaults.
- **Decision-making**: Supporting loan approvals or denials with data-driven insights.
- **Portfolio Management**: Monitoring and optimizing loan portfolios.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns and potential fraud.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring adherence to laws like HMDA and KYC.
- **Customer Insights**: Understanding customer behavior to tailor products.
- **Profitability Analysis**: Assessing loan portfolio profitability.
- **Market Research**: Analyzing trends to guide business strategies.
- **Credit Risk Management**: Managing and mitigating potential losses.
- **Customer Retention**: Identifying opportunities for refinancing or offering new products.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Loan Applications**: Tracks the total number of loan applications, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
- **Total Funded Amount**: Measures the total funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM comparisons.
- **Total Amount Received**: Monitors total repayments from borrowers, assessing cash flow with MTD and MoM analysis.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Calculates the average interest rate across all loans, tracking MTD and MoM variations.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluates borrowers' financial health by calculating average DTI, with MTD and MoM tracking.

### Good Loan KPIs

- **Good Loan Application Percentage**: Percentage of applications classified as 'Good Loans'.
- **Good Loan Applications**: Total number of 'Good Loans' applications.
- **Good Loan Funded Amount**: Total funds disbursed for 'Good Loans'.
- **Good Loan Total Received Amount**: Repayments received from 'Good Loans'.

### Bad Loan KPIs

- **Bad Loan Applications**: Total number of 'Bad Loans' applications.
- **Bad Loan Funded Amount**: Total funds disbursed for 'Bad Loans'.
- **Bad Loan Total Received Amount**: Repayments received from 'Bad Loans'.

### Charts

- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart)**: Identifies seasonality and trends in lending activities.
